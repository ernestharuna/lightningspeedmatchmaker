- Mail Controller

This PHP code validates the input data received from a form using Laravel's validate method. The $request variable is an instance of Laravel's Illuminate\Http\Request class, which represents the HTTP request sent to the server. The validate method is called on the $request object to ensure that the required form fields are present and valid.
The $data variable is then assigned the validated form data. It contains the values of the send_to, title, and content fields.
Next, a match expression is used to determine which users should receive the message based on the value of the send_to field. 
The match expression is a new feature in PHP 8 that allows you to write more concise switch statements. It takes an expression and compares it against several possible values, executing the code block associated with the first matching value.
In this case, the match expression takes the value of the send_to field and compares it against the values "verified", "unverified", and "all". Depending on the value of send_to, it retrieves a list of users using the appropriate Laravel Eloquent query. If the value of send_to is not one of the defined values, it retrieves all users by default.
Finally, the $users variable contains the list of users that should receive the message based on the value of send_to. It is now ready to be used to send the message to the selected users.
